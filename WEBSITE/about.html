            About YOU
          </h1>
          <p>YOU is active in humanitarian, educational, health care, public policy, social, human rights, environmental, and other areas to
effect changes according to their objectives.         </p>
          <p class="dark">
            YOU is thus a subgroup of all organizations
founded by citizens, which include clubs and other associations that provide services, benefits,
and premises only to members. Sometimes the term is used as a synonym of "civil society
organization" to refer to any association founded by citizens, but this is not how the term is
normally used in the media or everyday language, as recorded by major dictionaries. The
explanation of the term by NGO.org (the non-governmental organizations associated with the
United Nations) is ambivalent. It first says an NGO is any non-profit, voluntary citizens group
which is organized on a local, national or international level, but then goes on to restrict the
meaning in the sense used by most English speakers and the media: Task-oriented and driven by
people with a common interest, YOU perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions,
bring citizen concerns to Governments, advocate and monitor policies and encourage political
participation through provision of information.</p>

            <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> The Team</h3>
            <p>It is easy for many of us to express our grief and show some concern toward the helplessness
that we see around. But, it takes an immense amount of courage, hard-work, dedication and
most importantly a kind heart to stand for those who are in need. The Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) are neither a part of a government nor a conventional for-profit
business. Such selfless efforts deserve a salute. And thus we'd like you to appreciate the cause and join YOU's team, the most compatible and commendable team. You can call our hotline (+011-69696969) or email us (YOUforyou@YOUth.com)</p>
