# ProjectsR
Here I have embedded a few of the projects I have built and/or have worked on.  

Interned at FarmGuide.in for 30 days where I worked on Holistically-Nested Edge Detection project on the farms of India.  I was responsible for the training data required for the model to train on.

Interned at Gtrac.in for a good 2 month period where I worked on web development and data visualization in python and PHP.

I am looking for more exposure and knowledge in the AI/ML industry and new challenges that come along.
